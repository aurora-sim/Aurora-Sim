    ;; How many regions away should we allow child agents
    ;; This sets the number of regions in any direction we can see. The default is to be able to see in any direction 1 region. You can set this number to 2 or greater so that you can see X regions in every direction from the sim the agent is in. For example, if you have a 4 by 4 region setup, and you wish to be able to see into all of them, you would set the setting to 4 so that you can see across all of your regions. This is figured by the region in the southwest corner region position's X - the max region position's X, which in our test case is 4.
    ;; Default: 1
