How to use the optional ODE modules

x64 modules:
NOTE: YOU MUST HAVE .NET 4 FOR THIS TO WORK

1): Rename Ode.NETx64.dll to Ode.NET.dll
2): Rename odex64.dll to ode.dll
3): Copy these two files into the bin directory and overwrite the originals (make a backup of the old files first!)
4): Recompile Aurora with the x64 compile flag set (use one of the x64 prebuild options if you don't know how)
5): Start Aurora.exe

x86 modules (SSE1 and SSE2)

1): Rename the SSE version you want to Ode.dll
2): Copy the renamed file over into the bin directory and overwrite the originals (Make a backup of the old files first!)
3): Restart Aurora.exe
