[Sun]
    ;; The following to control the progression of daytime in the Sim.
    ;; The defaults are what is shown below
    ;; number of wall clock hours for an opensim day.  24.0 would mean real time
    day_length = 4
    ;; Year length in days
    year_length = 60
    ;; Day to Night Ratio
    day_night_offset = 0.5
    ;; send a Sun update every update_interval # of frames.  A lower number will
    ;; make for smoother sun transition at the cost of network
    update_interval = 100

[Wind]
    ;; Enables the wind module.  Default is true
    enabled = true

    ;; How often should wind be updated, as a function of world frames.  Approximately 50 frames a second
    wind_update_rate = 150

    ;; The Default Wind Plugin to load (Comment out if using ConfigurableWind)
    wind_plugin = SimpleRandomWind
    ;; This setting is specific to the SimpleRandomWind plugin (Comment out if using ConfigurableWind)
    ;; Adjusts wind strength. 0.0 = no wind, 1.0 = normal wind.  Default is 1.0
    strength = 1.0

    ;; These settings are specific to the ConfigurableWind plugin   (Optimally for variable winds more realistic)
    ;; To use ConfigurableWind as the default, simply change wind_plugin to ConfigurableWind and uncomment the following.
    ; wind_plugin = ConfigurableWind
    ; avg_strength = 5.0
    ; avg_direction = 0.0
    ; var_strength  = 0.0
    ; var_direction = 0.0
    ; rate_change   = 1.0

    ;; EXAMPLE Values For Sailing and More Active Winds
    ;; Use With ConfigurableWind
    ;; avg_strength  = 3.0
    ;; avg_direction = 90.0
    ;; var_strength  = 1.0
    ;; var_direction = 10.0
    ;; rate_change   = 1.0

[Cloud]
    ;; Enable this to generate classic particle clouds above the sim.
    ;; default is disabled - turn it on here
    enabled = false

    ;; Density of cloud cover 0.0 to 1.0 Default 0.5
    density = 0.5

    ;; update interval for the cloud cover data returned by llCloud() in milliseconds (take the amount you want times 1000)
    ;; default is 1000
    cloud_update_rate = 1000

[Trees]
    ;; Enable this to allow the tree module to manage your sim trees, including growing, reproducing and dying
    ;; Reference: REFERENCE: Tree Module Tutorial + (October 2010) http://forums.osgrid.org/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=2865&start=0
