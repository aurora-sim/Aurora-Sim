    ;; AuroraOpenDynamicsEngine is by some distance the most developed physics engine and is the main supported physics engine of Aurora
	;; This is the slower, OpenSim and old Aurora-Sim style movement configuration, the next option enables faster avatar movement, which feels more like Second Life
    ;Include-AuroraOpenDynamicsEngine = Configuration/Physics/AuroraOpenDynamicsEngine.ini 
	;; Makes AuroraOpenDynamicsEngine avatars feel like they are in Second Life
    Include-SLAuroraOpenDynamicsEngine = Configuration/Physics/SecondLifeFeelingAuroraOpenDynamicsEngine.ini 

    ;; ModifiedBulletSim is an alternate physics engine that is not as developed and has plenty of bugs still to work out.
    ;Include-ModifiedBulletSim = Configuration/Physics/BulletPhysics.ini 

    ;; The most basic of all BasicPhysics
