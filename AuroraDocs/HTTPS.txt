HTTPS in Aurora is pretty... unused, but that's not to say it can't be done (at least with Windows, I don't know whether mono supports HTTPS in it's implementation of HttpListener)!

Basically, you need to go into Aurora.Server.ini, and in the [Network] section, set 
  use_https = true
  and from a config standpoint, that's pretty much all you need to do.
  Then you need to basically follow the first answer of this URL, which is repeated below. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11403333/httplistener-with-https-support
  Good Luck!
  
  Now for the certificate side of things, using Win SDK command console (can also use VS Professional command console) 
	a) use makecert.exe to create a certificate authority. Example:
		makecert -n "CN=vMargeCA" -r -sv vMargeCA.pvk vMargeCA.cer
	b) use makecert.exe to create an ssl certificate
		makecert -sk vMargeSignedByCA -iv vMargeCA.pvk -n "CN=vMargeSignedByCA" -ic   
		  vMargeCA.cer vMargeSignedByCA.cer -sr localmachine -ss My
	c) use MMC gui to install CA in Trusted Authority store d) use MMC gui to install ssl cert in Personal store e) bind certificate to ip:port and application. Example:
		netsh http add sslcert ipport=0.0.0.0:8443        
          certhash=585947f104b5bce53239f02d1c6fed06832f47dc     
          appid={df8c8073-5a4b-4810-b469-5975a9c95230}
  The certhash is the thumbprint from your ssl certificate. you can find this using mmc
  The appid is found in VS...usually in assembly.cs, look for guid value
  
  There may be other ways to accomplish the above, but this worked for me.
